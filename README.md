# TitanicSurvivorPredictor-A-Machine-Learning-Approach

The Titanic disaster is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, leading to the deaths of 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew. This project aims to use machine learning techniques to predict whether a given passenger survived or not based on the features provided in the dataset.

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on the dataset provided by Kaggle. The dataset includes information such as passenger age, sex, Pclass, and Ticket Price that are used to make predictions.
